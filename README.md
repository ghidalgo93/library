# A Simple Library Application 
A simple library application with local storage designed to catalogue books you have read.

[Project Page] 

## Instructions
#### Main Library
The main library is where book cards are displayed. Once loaded in, books can be removed or have their read status changed.

Add books by clicking on the "+ New Book" button, located at the top of the page. Enter a book title, author, pages, and read status. If an entry is missing any of this information, a card will not be submitted.

Your personal library will persist over browser sessions.

## Personal Notes
Beautiful design is something I am actively working on, and with many incredible examples from other students of The Odin Project, I used one example I was particularly fond of to base my library design, I want to make sure that I give credit to the project of [CatQueenCodes](https://github.com/CatQueenCodes/Project-Library). Thank you for your inspiration! 

Project Start: 12/11/2020. For this project, I am attempting to start with a larger view of my project: planning in order to make my projet modular, functional, and lasting. I hope to be able to use some of the structures in this project for future projects and learn valuable technologies such as local storage and eventually the online database Firebase.

Project End: 12/18/2020. I came back to this project with the hopes of implementing better straties to both make this project modular and lasting, and although I have a great many things to learn I am proud of the opportunity I had to learn from others' and from wrestling with these concepts myself. 

Future Notes: I hope to come back and implement Firebase in the near future.
